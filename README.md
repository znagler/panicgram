Panicgram is a unique, fast-paced anagram-finding game.

As a former obsessed Scrabble player, I understand the strange thrill that rearranging letters brings some people.  With Panicgram I wanted to offer a new outlet for those people with some particular components in mind.

1) I wanted to only allow words that are 5 letters or longer.  This is because in most word games I have found, players who memorize all two and three letter words have a huge advantage, and I didn't want the game to be about memorization.

2) I didn't want the game to be pure anagrams or sub-anagrams (like Text Twist and others), but to have a new dynamic for valid plays.  This is the reason for the 'containing letters', 'containing letters in the right order' and 'containining consecutive letters' rules.  I acknowledgde the rules are not as simple as one may hope, and they might seem convoluted, but I believe that the gameplay is more fun and original, and worth the 5-minute investment to learn.

3) I wanted fast-paced games that only take a minute or two to finish-- not a game to play in the background but a 'high-bandwidth' but short experience.

4)  This is a no-brainer, but I wanted a clean and minimalist but pretty UI/UX.  I am happy with how the game looks now but I will keep working at it.
