          <li><i>What happens if I am stuck?</i><br>
          The game is designed so nobody should be stuck for too long-- there are always common words that will score you 2 points.  For example, with "NQUIX," you can play any word that contains "nq" consecutively, such as "inquire", "conquer", "tranquil", etc.</li>
          <br><br>
          <li><i>What's the strategy?</i><br>
          If the 5 shown letters are common and have a good mix of vowels and consonants, try to score 5.  If not, look at the first two letters and aim for a quick 2.  It is ALWAYS possible to score 2 with common words.  Remember: your word does not need to start with the first 2 shown letters, just contain them.</li>
          <br><br>
          <li><i>Why can I only use words that are 5 letters or longer?</i><br>
          This rule is in place to prevent the game from being all about memorizing short and bizarre (but legal) 2 and 3 letter words, as many other word games are.</li>
          <br><br>
          <li><i>What dictionary does the game use?</i><br>
          The game uses the Scrabble Official Tournament and Club Word List (OWL).</li>

          <li><i>How do I contact the creators?</i><br>
